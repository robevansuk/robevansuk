## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Byzgen blockchain platform to secure data using distributed threshold encryption
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a better team leader. Improving developer experience through faster builds (300%), more reliable tests (100%), increasing value demand as well as removing failure demand, simplifying processes and more.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about blockchain, AI, crypto, and systems design
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email/twitter
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built a crypto exchange API library for Coinbase (back when its trading front-end was called GDAX, rather than coinbase-pro). It currently has 175 stars and 130 forks
- I am currently working on building a database to enable property buyers/sellers to get an avg price for their area. This involves ingesting a few million lines of data for almost every property in the UK. Once created it should enable users to work out the average price/sqm (or sqft) for their location.
